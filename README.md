# MonoGame.Squid

An implementation of the Squid GUI library for MonoGame.

SQUID is an SDK to create user interfaces for games and other 2D/3D realtime applications, 
using a Retained Mode system. SQUID does not depend on a certain rendering engine, you can 
use it with any engine you like, on any platform that supports the .NET 2.0 framework.

It was originally created by [IONSTAR Studios](http://www.ionstar.org/?page_id=4).

Squid was [made open source](http://ionstar.org/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=ie2s5imp691rqr8t3e0oahbtp1&topic=195.0) on April 18, 2016. 
The original source code can be found [on github](https://github.com/Roderik11/Squid).

This fork adds a renderer for MonoGame.
